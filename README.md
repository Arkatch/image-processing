Image processing  
Implementation popular image processing methods in C.  
Support 8-bit grayscale, 24-bit rgb .bmp file and 3D 8/16-bit .raw images with .mhd files.  

Method for 8-bit grayscale image:  
-Salt and pepper  
-Median, Min, Max, Avg filters with custom size  
-Edge detection, Prewitt and Sobel method  
-K Means Clustering  
-Sharpen, Boxblur and Gaussianblur filters  
-Contrast stretch, negative  
-Color historgram   
-Growing region segmentation  
-Thickening, thinning, skeletonization  
-Binaryzation, median, Otsu, Bersen, Bersen median methods  

Method for 24-bit color image:  
-Salt and pepper  
-Median, Min, Max, Avg filters with custom size  
-Edge detection Sobel method  
-K Means Clustering  
-Convert to gray 
-Convert to gray by color  
-Only one color in image  

Method for 3D .raw images
-Median, Min, Max, Avg 3D/2D filters with custom size (16-bit)  
-3D Growing regionraw segmentation (8/16-bit)  
-3D skeletonization and thickening (8-bit)
